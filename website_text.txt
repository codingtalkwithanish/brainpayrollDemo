Success Stories
Fully integrated Pay & Bill and Payroll for the UK based leading recruitment agency
Improving efficiency through seamless system integrations and advanced automation
One of the largest privately-owned recruitment agencies in the UK had dependencies on various third-party systems with their existing payroll system. This led to less control over the operations, delayed responses to the workers, and lack of communication.
A London-based leading service provider of managed payroll & pension services had difficulties with the large payroll processing volume. Their existing software required a lot of manual intervention, which resulted in compromised service to their clients.
